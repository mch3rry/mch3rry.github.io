#### Laura & Donny

Danielle was  a huge help and instrumental to guiding a positive birth story. Donny and I felt very supported throughout and leading up to the birth of our baby girl born November 24, 2020. I truly do not believe I would have felt as mentally, physically or emotionally prepared for my labour and delivery without having her by my side. She was able to know my preferences and understand my concerns as well as Donny's and talk and guide us through them prior to birth, during labour and after with postpartum visits to our home. Having her arrive prior to the midwife to the labour was probably the most help I felt I needed mentally and emotionally in that moment. She has a calm and  reassuring presence as the intensity built I never felt her waiver. I was close to an induction due to my waters breaking before any contractions or active labour signs and once again I really believe if I was in a negative or anxious head space after my waters broke that I would not have entered labour as successfully naturally within the time window necessary prior to induction as so much of it relates to our psychological and emotional experience driving the hormones and processes that guide our bodies through birth. Danielle was foundational to my confidence and relaxation as the labour started and continued. I was able to follow my birth preferences and did not feel worried if things were to stray or have to change paths. I knew that no matter what she would advocate for our family and work along with the midwives to ensure that the experience was amazing and baby girl would enter  our lives in the best way possible in that moment. Discussing concerns and feelings with Danielle in prenatal sessions (for myself and Donny, my partner) was pivotal as it helped us communicate between eachother our personal worries or thoughts that we may not have otherwise realized or voiced out loud. I recommend her whole-heartedly!
