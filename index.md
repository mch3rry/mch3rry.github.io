    <h3>I am a birth and postpartum doula serving Vancouver, BC, and surrounding areas.</h3><br>
    <p>Doulas support birthing people throughout their pregrancy, labour and birth, as well as postpartum. (( more about doula support here )) You can read more about the evidence on doula care <a href="https://evidencebasedbirth.com/the-evidence-for-doulas/"><i>here</i></a>.</p><br>
    <p>I believe in intuition - that you, your body, and your baby intuitively know how to give birth.</p>
    <p>(( more beliefs ))</p>
    <p>(( even more beliefs ))</p><br>
    <p>Before I decided to pursue birth work, I studied neurobiology for ten years. From my time as a scientist I bring curiosity, critical thinking, and a love of research rabbit holes. Continuing education is a priority for me in my doula practice. I believe it is important to understand the history that shapes modern birth culture, and to always be informed on the current best practices in perinatal care.</p>
    <p>For my doula training I completed Pacific Rim's 270-hour <a href="https://www.pacificrimcollege.com/faculties-programs/program/holistic-doula-certificate/">Holistic Doula Program</a>.</p>

### Services

**Comprehensive Birth Doula Care** for you and your family includes:
* Unlimited phone/text/email support throughout your pregnancy, and up to 6 weeks postpartum
* On-call 24/7 for your birth, starting at 37 weeks 
* Two prenatal visits
  * We’ll review physiologic labour and childbirth, discuss comfort measures and your birth preferences, and put together a postpartum plan. The goal is to ensure you are educated about all of your options, ease any concerns you or your partner may have, and make you feel confident and empowered about your ability to birth.
* Continuous labour support
  * Whether you’re birthing at the hospital, or in your home, I’ll join you when your birthing time comes, and will be by your side to encourage and assist you throughout your labour. I’ll remain with you for a few hours after the birth, until you and your new family are settled in.
* Two postpartum visits
  * Visits occur in the first ten days following the birth. They are an opportunity to debrief the birth, revel in your new baby, receive support in newborn care and feeding, or take the time for rest and recuperation.

**Fee:** ~~$800~~ *$400 for the first five families! *

**À la carte Postpartum Care** is available for $20/hour.
